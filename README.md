## Risk Profile Weighting

Portfolio allocation varies by investor risk tolerance:

### Conservative Profile
- **Stock Count**: 8 positions
- **Factor Weights**: 50% Fundamental, 30% Technical, 20% Sentiment
- **Economic Sensitivity**: 80% (high risk aversion)
- **Max Position**: 15% per stock
- **Best For**: Capital preservation with steady growth

### Moderate Profile
- **Stock Count**: 6 positions
- **Factor Weights**: 40% Fundamental, 35% Technical, 25% Sentiment
- **Economic Sensitivity**: 60% (balanced consideration)
- **Max Position**: 20% per stock
- **Best For**: Balanced growth and income

### Aggressive Profile
- **Stock Count**: 4 positions
- **Factor Weights**: 30% Fundamental, 35% Technical, 35% Sentiment
- **Economic Sensitivity**: 40% (accepts volatility)
- **Max Position**: 25% per stock
- **Best For**: Maximum growth potential

---

## Allocation Formula
```
Base Score = (Fundamental Ã— Wf) + (Technical Ã— Wt) + (Sentiment Ã— Ws)

Economic Adjustment:
  If Economic Risk > 0.5:
      Adjustment = max(0.70, 1.0 - (Risk Ã— Sensitivity Ã— 0.3))
  Elif Economic Risk > 0.3:
      Adjustment = max(0.85, 1.0 - (Risk Ã— Sensitivity Ã— 0.2))
  Else:
      Adjustment = 1.0

Final Score = Base Score Ã— Economic Adjustment
Position Weight = Final Score / Sum(All Final Scores)
```
